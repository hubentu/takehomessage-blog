# How to read number column with comma as thousands separator in CSV file?

The `readr::read_csv` function with `locale` option is able to parse numbers in different format.

```{r}
library(readr)
read_csv("x,y\n123,\"4,567\"", locale = locale(grouping_mark = ","))
```

A `thousands` option is available in the python pandas package.
```python
import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv(file, thousands = ",")
```
